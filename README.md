# envoy
2030.5 / CSIP-AUS utility server implementation

## Project structure

Top level directories define fastapi apps that use a common auth model

* `admin`: Used for internal API endpoints for administering the server/injecting calculated entities
* `server`: primary implementation of the public API's - eg 2030.5 etc 

docstrings on `__init__.py` should describe the structure in greater detail

## Running Locally

### Locally Hosted

To run Envoy locally as a development environment you'll need to setup a local postgresql database and python. This guide will assume that you have python 3.10+ and postgresql 14+ installed.

1. Install dependencies for main server + tests

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`pip install -r tests/requirements.txt`

2. Double check tests are running

`pytest`

3. Create an "envoy" database

```
sudo -u postgres psql
postgres=# create database envoydb;
postgres=# create user envoyuser with encrypted password 'mypass';
postgres=# grant all privileges on database envoydb to envoyuser;
```

4. Create `.env` file

Envoy is is dependent on a number of environment variables listed in the table below.

| Environment Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | The postgres database connection string eg: `postgresql+asyncpg://envoyuser:mypass@localhost:5432/envoydb` (NOTE - `asyncpg` is required for fastapi) |

We recommend adding these to a `.env` file in the root directory so that they are accessible by both fastapi and docker.

5. Install local copy

`pip install -e ./`

6. Apply alembic migrations to the database schema

`cd server/`

If there are no migrations in `server/alembic/versions` - first run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Init"`

`alembic upgrade head`

7. Start server

`python server/main.py`

### Docker Hosted
