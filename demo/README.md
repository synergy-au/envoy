# envoy demo server

This demo is designed to allow you to quickly evaluate the envoy server in a local development environment. It is not a "production grade" docker compose file. It's purely a way to quickly startup and evaluate the csip-aus implementation.

## Starting the demo

You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run this demo

**To start the demo:**

You will need to build an image called `envoy:latest` and then up the compose file:

```
# Run all the demo commands from the demo/ directory
cd demo/

# Build the default envoy image
docker build -t envoy:latest -f ../Dockerfile.server ../

# Up the demo compose file
HOST_UID=$(id -u) HOST_GID=$(id -g) docker compose up
```

This will start the following services:
* [nginx](https://nginx.org/): for providing TLS validation/termination 
    * testing client certificates and keys will generate in `./tls-termination/test_certs/`
    * Will expose and listen on port `8443`
    * Will only accept TLS connections with a client cert that has been signed by the "test CA" (see below)
* [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/): As the database provider
    * Database will be exposed to the host machine and accessible using: `postgresql+asyncpg://test_user:test_pwd@localhost:8003/test_db`
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/): As the messaging broker (underlies 2030.5 pub/sub)
* envoy: Requests are expected to be proxied through nginx as that will handle all of the certificate validation.
    *  Port `8000` will allow requests to access envoy directly but will require manually specifying `x-forwarded-client-cert`
* envoy-admin:
    * Port `8001` will allow requests to access the envoy-admin API directly.


## Client Certificate

The underlying IEEE 2030.5 standard requires specially signed certificates to identify clients. When this example is first executed, it will create the following files in the directory: 

`tls-termination/test_certs/`

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `testca.crt` | Certificate for the self signed certificate authority (CA) that will be signing the client/proxy certs |
| `testca.key` | Private Key for the self signed certificate authority (CA) that will be signing the client/proxy certs. Will have passphrase `testcapassphrase` |
| `testclient.crt` | Certificate for the client certificate registered to a testing "aggregator" |
| `testclient.key` | Private Key for the client certificate registered to a testing "aggregator". Will have passphrase `testclientpassphrase` |
| `testclient.p12` | P12/PFX combination of the `testclient.crt` and `testclient.key`. Will have passphrase `testclientpassphrase` |

You are welcome to sign additional certificates using the "test ca"

Any requests to the nginx instance on port 8443 will require a client certificate signed by the test CA.

## Making your first request

The easiest way to validate that the example services have started is by issuing a HTTPS request to localhost:8443/dcap

```
curl --cacert ./tls-termination/test_certs/testca.crt --cert ./tls-termination/test_certs/testclient.p12:testclientpassphrase --cert-type p12 https://localhost:8443/dcap

# This should generate a response like this:
<DeviceCapability xmlns="urn:ieee:std:2030.5:ns" xmlns:csipaus="https://csipaus.org/ns" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="/dcap"><EndDeviceListLink href="/edev" all="0"/><MirrorUsagePointListLink href="/mup" all="0"/></DeviceCapability>
```

## Connecting with Postman

In the root repository directory under `postman/` you'll find Postman collections for both envoy and envoy-admin. 

You'll need to import them and then do the following:
1. File -> Settings -> Certificates -> Client Certificates -> Add Certificate
    * Set the certificate host to `https://localhost:8443`
    * Set the PFX file to `testclient.p12` (see table above for passphrase and other info)
2. envoy collection -> Variables
    * Set HOST to `localhost:8443`


## Initial Database Content

When first loaded, the database will be loaded with the bare minimum to run envoy and connect. Only a test aggregator with a linked client certificate will be loaded.

This will be enough to run `EndDevice` registration workflows.

In order to receive dynamic operating envelopes / prices / etc, they will need to be injected via the admin-server. Please see the example Postman collections for how to do that.
